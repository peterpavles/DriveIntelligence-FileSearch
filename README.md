With this application you can search for files which filename contains a specific term.

Example : Search all files in all drives with filename that contains ".mp3"


You can also list all existing files in all drives in a result text file (launch the .EXE in admin mode and enable the checkbox associated to this option, then click on "Scan" and you will get a full list of all the files existing on your Windows machine).
